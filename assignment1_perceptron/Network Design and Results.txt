1. Weights:

Perceptron 1:
- Initial weights = [0, 0, 0]
- Final weights = [-5, 1.8, 2.4]

Perceptron 2 = 
- Initial weights = [-2000, 0, 0]
- Final weights = [-1934, 353.35, 134.2 ]


2. Total classification error = 0


3. 
Total number of iterations used:
- Perceptron 1 = 5
- Perceptron 2 = 13

No terminating criteria was used. Instead, the networks were initially trained with a large number of iterations and an error vs. iterations plot was produced to determine the minimal iterations needed

4.
Precision = 1
